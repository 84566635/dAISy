Updating the Firmware
---------------------

To update the firmware, you need the programming software from TI. It's part of a bigger package, but for your convenience I made the relevant executable available [here](http://www.adrianstuder.com/daisy/BSL_USB_GUI.zip) (sorry, Windows only)

If you are currently running a firmware version older than 4.0, you will also need to update dAISy's USB driver. Use [this driver](http://www.adrianstuder.com/daisy/daisyUSB%20inf%20v2.zip), when Windows prompts you for a new driver after the upgrade.

**Upgrade procedure**

1.	Connect to dAISy with a terminal program.

2.	Enter bootloader mode.
	- Enter the debug menu by pressing *ESC*.
	- Start the boot loader by pressing *B*.
	
3.	Close the terminal program.

4.	Start *BSL_USB_GUI.exe*.

5.	Press *Next*, accept agreement, press *Next*.

6.	Choose option *Select Firmware* and browse to the firmware file provided.
	
	**IMPORTANT**: *DO NOT* program dAISy with the LED and Echo examples, it will brick the device!

7.	The *Upgrade Firmware* button should be active and “Found 1 device” is displayed below the button.
	- If not, make sure dAISy is connected and you entered bootloader mode as described above.
	- If that does not work, connect dAISy directly to your computer without a USB hub and try again.
	
8.	Press Upgrade Firmware.

	The upgrade should only take a few seconds.
	
9.	After successful upgrade, dAISy should be available again.

	In some cases you might need to disconnect and reconnect dAISy
	
10.	The version information in the debug menu should now read:

	*dAISy USB v4.01x* followed by hardware information, e.g. *dAISy USB 3 (5503)*

Please let me know if you run into any issues.
