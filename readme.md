dAISy - A simple DIY AIS Receiver
=================================

dAISy (do AIS yourself) is a simple AIS receiver based on Silicon Labs Si4362 EZRadioPro receiver, Texas Instruments MSP430G2553 and MSP-EXP430G2 v1.5 LaunchPad. The software was developed with Code Composer Studio 5.5.

AIS, short for "Automatic Identification System", is a tracking systems for ships. More on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System). There are many sites dedicated to tracking ships around the world based on this system, like for example [MarineTraffic](http://www.marinetraffic.com/).

dAISy features:
- tuned to 161.975 MHz (channel A)
- receiving and decoding packets according to ITU-R M.1371-4 (NRZI decoding, bit-destuffing, CRC validation) 
- wrapping valid packets into NMEA 0183 sentences (AIVDM)
- sending NMEA sentences to PC via serial (9600 8N1)

The output of dAISy can be processed and visualized by navigation programs like [OpenCPN](http://opencpn.org).
